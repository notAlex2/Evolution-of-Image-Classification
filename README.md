# ML Model Optimization Strategies for Image Datasets

## Abstract
Classification is one of several common tasks undertaken by machine learning. This paper provides an
overview of some machine learning architectures (Support Vector Machines, Multi-Layer Perceptron,
Convolutional Neural Networks) and evaluates their suitability for classification within the domain of
computer vision. Then, we proceed to evaluate the performance of such architectures under varying
hyperparameters and other conditions, such as neural network shape, regularization, and augmented
data, to inquire into methods for optimizing model performance in respect of image classification.
